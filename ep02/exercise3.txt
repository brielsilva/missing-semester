Say you have a command that fails rarely. In order to debug it you need to capture its output but it can be time consuming 
to get a failure run. Write a bash script that runs the following script until 
it fails and captures its standard output and error streams to files and prints everything at the end. 
Bonus points if you can also report how many runs it took for the script to fail.

echo "Running error.sh $(date)"
try=0

./error.sh
while [ $? -ne 1 ] ; do
    try=$(($try + 1))
    ./error.sh
done
try=$(($try + 1))

echo "The program was executed $try times"
